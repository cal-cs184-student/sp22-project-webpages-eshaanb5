        <p>
            Our fluid simulation is an implementation of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics fluid simulation method,
            which uses the properties of a few discrete points in the fluid to approximate the properties of the entire
            fluid. The fluid is modeled as a collection of point mass objects which carry position, velocity, and other
            attributes. At a high level, we numerically approximated Navier-Stokes equations for fluids to compute the
            particles’ dynamics. A basic fluid simulation only taking into account gravitational forces and
            incompressibility was first created. Then, additional forces from factors such as viscosity and surface
            tension were added to create a more realistic picture of fluid behavior. The behavior of particles upon
            collision with spherical and flat objects was modeled. Particles were shaded to give them a waterlike look,
            with color changing according to their height to allow for a better visualization of effects such as
            splashing.

        <h2 align="middle">Technical approach</h3>
            <p>
                Our code was based off of our implementation for project 4, Cloth Simulator. We used PointMass objects
                with properties like position, velocity, density, and pressure for our fluid particles. We implemented
                the simulation loop described in <a
                    href="https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/sca03.pdf">Muller et al (2003)</a>. For
                all of our simulations, we started with a 0.2 x 0.2 x 0.2 unit cube of 42875 particles. Our simulation
                uses a smoothed particle hydrodynamics approach, which computes the properties of the fluid at any point
                in space by interpolating the values at finitely many discrete locations. This is done through the use
                of multiple kernel functions. We computed 3 kernel functions that we used to approximate many of the
                necessary quantities such as density, pressure, viscosity, and surface tension by considering the
                contributions for a given particle from each nearby particle. These kernels are given by the following
                equations:
                </br>
                <img src="poly6 kernel.png">
                </br>
                <img src="spiky kernel.png">
                </br>
                <img src="viscosity kernel.png">
                </br>

                where h is a constant which specifies the maximum possible distance at which another particle should
                contribute, and r is the distance between the two particles in question. For our simulations, we used h
                = 0.104.


            </p>
            <p>
                The poly6 kernel is used for surface tension and density calculations as it is fast to compute, since it
                only uses the squared distance. The spiky kernel is used for pressure calculations as it has a non-zero
                gradient when particles are close together, which is needed to prevent particles from clumping together
                as the pressure force is dependent on the gradient of the kernel function. The viscosity is dependent on
                the laplacian of the kernel, and thus the viscosity kernel function was chosen such that the laplacian
                is always positive. We calculated all derivatives by hand analytically, and implemented the functions
                directly.

                In addition to external forces, there were three additional forces we implemented using our kernel
                functions to simulate the fluid dynamics. These are all the forces implemented in the Mueller paper.
                First, we added a pressure force which enforces incompressibility of the fluid through the ideal gas law
                by pushing particles apart if the density around a certain particle is greater than the rest density,
                which is a constant we chose. The density for the ith particle is given by </br>

                <img src="density eq.png"> </br>

                where m is the mass (we set this to 1) and W is the poly6 kernel. The pressure for the ith particle is
                then given by </br>

                <img src="pressure state eq.png"> </br>

                where &rho;<sub>0</sub> is the rest density (a constant we chose, based on the initial density of the
                fluid cube),
                and k is the ideal gas constant, which effects the strength of the pressure force (we chose a value of
                0.00000005). Finally, the pressure force for the ith particle is given by </br>


                <img src="pressure force eq.png"> </br>

                where W is now the spiky kernel. Note that all sums are over all particles, but the kernels only
                contribute for close particles.
            </p>
            <p>

                Next, we implemented a viscosity force, which is given by the following for the ith particle.</br>


                <img src="viscosity eq.png"></br>


                Here, &mu; is the viscosity constant (we used 0.0005), m is mass, v is velocity, &rho; is density, and W
                is
                the viscosity kernel. The viscosity acts on the velocities of the particles by slowing them down when
                they are close to each other. Below, we can see our fluid both with and without viscosity.</br>


                Notice that the fluid with viscosity is slightly more constrained in its motion. Finally, we implemented
                surface tension. We first needed to find the normal field and curvature of the surface, which are given
                by the following equations.</br>


                <img src="normal eq.png"></br>

                <img src="curvature eq.png"></br>


                Here, C<sub>s</sub> is approximated by the poly6 kernel. Then, we use these to compute the surface
                tension force
                using the equation below.
                </br>

                <img src="surface tension eq.png"></br>


                where &sigma; is a constant (we used 0.000000000001). The surface tension pulls particles on the surface
                of the fluid closer to the fluid, preventing excessive splashing. We can see the effects in the
                following comparison.</br>

                <iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zg9aEnN0uA5knMjGRBd9rSEZr71A3unV/preview" width="640"
                    height="480" allow="autoplay" align="middle"></iframe>

                Notice that the splash is much more constrained with surface tension. After computing these forces for
                each particle, the constant gravitational force is added to each particle’s forces as well. Then, Euler
                integration is used to compute the new positions and velocities of each particle. Going a bit beyond the
                Mueller paper, we implemented collisions with objects such as planes and spheres, which are handled by
                reflecting the particle’s velocity about the normal to the surface of collision with some damping
                coefficient. In order to improve the visualization of the particles, we also added slight transparency
                to make them appear more water-like and changed the color of the particles as a function of their
                height, to better visualize the splashing effects of the fluid particles.</br>

                The main problems we encountered in our implementation were with the tuning of the parameters of the
                simulation, especially for large particle counts. We learned that the simulation is extremely sensitive
                to the chosen values of parameters, which can cause a lot of difficulty when combined with very slow
                computation times that make it hard to see if the parameters are set right. We tackled this problem by
                attempting to pick parameters in a physically motivated way, and also by simple trial and error, trying
                to identify issues early in the simulation. For some parameters, such as the rest fluid density, we
                calculated these variables based on the number of particles we used and the size of the fluid cube to
                avoid manually tuning for every size combination we tested. Another issue that we had was an attractive
                force between particles when their density was lower than the rest density. This would either result in
                the outermost particles collapsing inward in an attempt to reach a higher density if the rest density
                was set to the density of the middle of the fluid, or the interior particles expanding outward if the
                density was set to match the outer particles to avoid the former effect. This was resolved by removing
                any attractive negative pressure components from particle force calculations, which was suggested by
                some implementations of fluid simulations to resolve instability. Throughout this project, we learned a
                lot about the physics behind fluids and how various physical effects in fluid can be translated into
                approximate dynamics.
